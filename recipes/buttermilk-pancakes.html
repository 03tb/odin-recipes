        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>A very light and fluffy pancake recipe that requires fresh buttermilk, but it's the best I've ever made!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Flour</li>
            <li>Sugar</li>
            <li>Leaveners</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Buttermilk</li>
            <li>Eggs</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><em>Mix the dry ingredients:</em> Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl.</li>
            <li><em>Mix the wet ingredients: </em>Beat the buttermilk, milk, eggs, and melted butter together in a separate bowl. Do not combine the wet and dry ingredients until right before you cook the pancakes.</li>
            <li><em>Make the pancakes: </em>Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix with a wooden spoon or fork until the mixtures are just-blended. Scoop the batter onto a hot, oiled griddle and cook until the pancake is bubbly on the top. Flip with a spatula and cook until both sides are brown.</li>
        </ol>
